# fuzzcover - test suite generation for C++

*You write the code, we write the tests.*

## About

**Fuzzcover** is a set of utilities to use [libFuzzer](http://libfuzzer.info) to generate tests to achieve a high function coverage of code of your choice. It bases on the ideas presented in the talk [**Testing Legacy Code - Fuzzing for Better Input Data**](https://meetingcpp.com/mcpp/slides/2019/Testing%20Legacy%20Code%20-%20Fuzzing%20for%20Better%20Input%20Data.pdf) by Tina Ulbrich and Niel Waldren on [Meeting C++ 2019](https://meetingcpp.com/2019/).

While the talk presents the overall framework of how fuzz testing can be used to generate test cases, **fuzzcover** aims to automate as many steps as possible.

## Process

1. Implement the `fuzzcover_interface` defined `include/fuzzcover/fuzzcover.hpp` in:
	- choose the **test input type** (e.g., `double`, `std::string`, or any other type from which you can feed the test function
	- implement function **`value_from_bytes`** which generates a test input from some bytes generated by libFuzzer
	- implement function **`test_function`** which takes a test input and executes whatever code you want to improve the test coverage for
2. Implement three binaries defined in `CMakeLists.txt`, which boils down to replacing the include and class name to fit your implementation from step 1:
	- **`fuzzer`** to plug libFuzzer to your test function
	- **`tester`** to execute your test function with the generated test inputs, usually to check for coverage
	- **`dumper`** to dump the test inputs in JSON format
3. Run the targets to do the actual jobs:
	- **`run_fuzzer`** runs the fuzzer and populates a directory "corpus" with test inputs
	- **`check_coverage`** generates a coverage report for the generated test inputs in the "corpus" directory
	- **`minimize_corpus_files`** removes test inputs from the "corpus" directory which do no contribute to coverage; the result is usually a much smaller test suite
	- **`minimize_corpus_length`** tries to reduce the size of each test input; this is usually necessary, because libFuzzer may generate long byte sequences from which function `value_from_bytes` only consumes a small prefix

## Examples

Folder `examples` contains several example implementations that generate tests for various functions from [JSON for Modern C++](https://github.com/nlohmann/json). If you do not change anything in the code, `examples/json/fuzzer_lexer_scan_number.hpp` is used and ready to go. Running the targets in step 3 above will generate enough strings to cover all lines of the number parser of the JSON library.

## Dependencies

- [Clang](http://clang.llvm.org)
- [libFuzzer](http://libfuzzer.info)
- [lcov](http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php) (to check coverage)
- [Python](https://www.python.org) (for helper scripts that reduce the test suite's size)

## Roadmap

- [ ] generate an actual test suite (e.g., for [Catch](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) or [ApprovalTests.cpp](https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.cpp)
- [ ] improve scripts to accelerate corpus reduction (e.g., using binary search)
- [ ] remove lcov dependency
- [ ] add CI
- [ ] add tutorial
